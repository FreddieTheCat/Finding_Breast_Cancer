# Finding_Breast_Cancer
Trained model to find breast cancer

In this project we will train the model in order to make a binary clasification prediction, concretely if the class is "Malignant" or "Bening".
For this binary classification problem we will build a CNN model in Tensorflow 2.0 (tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc0)

*For this problem we will use "load_breast_cancer" dataset from sklearn(data is already split into features and target). Dataset can also be found here(if data is generated from Kaggle,it has to be splitted): https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data#data.csv


Prerequisites:
Tensorflow=2.0
Pandas=0.25.1
Numpy=1.16.4
Matplotlib=3.1.1
Sklearn=0.22.1
